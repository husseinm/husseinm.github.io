title: S.P.A.M. Grandpa Game 
---

**Note:** This is a story of 14 year-old me and a group of kids from my School District's cross High School Robotics team, S.P.A.M., during one of my most memorable times there. Please remember all the students were approximately 14 years old, this was a selected subgroup of kids on the team, and is no way indicative of the behavior of the individuals today, nor of anyone currently on that team - also please know I did actually write some kind of useful robot code during my 4 year tenure on the team, and didn't just screw around...

*Sigh*... So this is an OLD OLD project of mine. I (kind of) wrote this when I was 14. The entire point
of this project was to teach my fellow members of FRC team 180 how to program. Here's how the
story goes:

It was the beginning of the season, and I asked all of our new programming sub-team members what they wanted to program for their **very first** project. Of course being incredibly intelligent high schoolers on a robotics
team from academically high achieving schools, they all had the very same idea and looked at each
other as though it was
some sort of alien-like telepathy. Then after the very brief silence, I was blasted by the voices
of six shrieking 14 year-old fan-girls showing themselves through the medium of six awkward and nerdy 14 year-old males via the words "VIDEO
GAME!"

After the Tinnitus stopped ringing my ears like a bell, I thought to myself that it could be a good idea, and we could show it to the public FRC community for marketing purposes so I replied for their own sake "Fine - as long as it is not a 3D game or an RPG" - almost instantly I received enough collective sighing, moaning and groaning to feel as though I stood in the midst of an orgy. Then there was *that kid* who stopped everyone's animal-like moaning for a moment and said in his very scratchy voice:

>Hey guys, it's not the end of the world, we can build this super
cool game idea I have.
>
>Imagine a grandfather who used to live a great life, he had a beautiful
>granddaughter, you know that perfect middle-class life sh***.
>
>The next day grandpa is driving home from the grocery store and pulling in, grandma calls and says where are you? Worried grandma will find out about the hooker badass gramps was just with, gramps floors it and pulls some serious *Need for Speed*&trade; sh*** to get home soon.
>
>The next thing you know, **bam**, the little girl is dead on the windshield, blood is everywhere and the grandpa is hysterical, he goes into shock, and over the next couple of years he becomes an alcoholic, gets divorced, then develops a heroin addiction.
>
>Now one dark stormy night he OD's and the game part cues in - you are in the grandpa's nightmare-esque coma. You play the granddaughter who died at her grandfather's hands. Grandpa sees you at the side of his bed and starts to chase you, violently, with his most recently used heroin needle in hand.
>
>So now the game is you are running away from your now violent and murderous grandpa playing in the confines of the coma, trying to avoid grandpa's huge oversized and used heroin needles from stabbing you.

Of course that kid<sup>[1](#ps-1)</sup> then proceeded to use his amazing illustration skills to wonderfully draw the entire scene
while explaining it in black and red Expo&trade; on the whiteboard.
  
Now I being the mature programming wunderkind decided to greenlight the idea, so I then showed the
idea to my programming mentor on the team and of course he... **loved** the idea (I am being
serious, he truly did).

Then of course he broke the bad news of how he still had to veto the project though since it was too inappropriate to release to the
public for team marketing. 

So we literally went back to the drawing board<sup>[2](#ps-2)</sup> and once we calmed down from
the hilarious grandpa idea, we reworked the idea into a much more appropriate project called the S.P.A.M.
Grandpa game, and carefully made sure to incorporate the passing reference of the Grandpa.

The new idea was that you would play a "Super Spammer" who would try to collect the *good* cans of
SPAM&trade;, and avoid everything else which was harmful to him. The entire goal of the game was to
last as long as possible. Then the grandpa comes in, see the grandpa when hit would make the objects
fly at you twice as fast, but also double the time/points earned within the period. 
Whenever you hit anything that wasn't a can or the grandpa you lost a life - if you lost all
your lives you lost. It was that simple.

So we went off and started building this project, we split off into subteams - namely design,
programming, and music<sup>[3] (#ps-3)</sup>
The design team eventually made all the art work and over many Saturdays, pizza, soda and
inappropriate jokes we had all the artwork and music completed. During this time frame, I had taught the new programmers the
basics of programming and how to write JavaScript, particularly in a Unity setting.

We had all the artwork done and the new programmers knew enough to code the project so I let them
loose with one week to write the code. Then came the day of our Robotics competition and
here we are at 6 a.m. loading everything on the bus, getting our bags checked<sup>[4] (#ps-4)</sup> and I asked them for a demo of the game. They looked at each other with "the face" and
told me that it wasn't done yet, so I asked for the code and for the 3 hour bus drive, I **hacked**
(emphasis on hacked) the
code together as best as I could<sup>[5](#ps-5)
</sup>
At the end of the ride I finished the project just in time, we arrived at the regional, I setup the kiosk and we had our game up and running.

Now I could end the story here, but I would be remiss if I didn't explain the Konami code
behavior...

When you enter the Konami code at the title screen, a scantly clad female character
begins to play, and if you examine the source code file's name is "SecondClass" - now of course this might send off a
misogynistic messages to the brains of my finely educated and beautiful/hansome readers, but there is a story
behind this as well.

See while designing the game, the artists created the original characters
without clothing and had random people on the team review the proportions<sup>[6](#ps-6)</sup>, and we would then would place the clothing on top.

Of course the artist being a 14 year-old decided to make a version with a bikini before
fully clothing her as a joke for all of us in the room. They were about to add more clothes, when I stopped him and said no - we *will* find a way to integrate that
into the game as an easter egg.

So queue back to the day of the competition after having set up the kiosk and everything being ready to go - I decided to spend the time we spent in between our robot's matches doing two things:
1. Adding a scoreboard
2. Finding a way to incorporate the scantly clad female. 

Of course after finishing #1, I was sitting next to a different mentor whilst doing #2 - I asked for his
opinion on how to include the character as an easter egg, he then made remarks about sexism and how social norms were what caused us to make the female character the scantly clad one<sup>[7](#ps-7)
</sup>
But he then came up with the idea of the character being a secret konami mode - so to be as sassy as I could in response to the sexism speech I called the file SecondClass and thus the mode was born.

Throughout the competetition, I took pride in that as people would play our game and become impressed with it<sup>[8](#ps-8)</sup> - we would consistently get asked what was the point of the grandpa in the game
and we would all smile and say: "It's a long story"

1. Unsurprisingly, that kid got a Film & Computer Science dual degree, I think you can see why.

<a id="ps-2"></a>
2. Which was conveniently 1 foot away from us since we
were all sandwiched in this spectacularly small room we called "the hole"

<a id="ps-3"></a>
3. Which of course consisted solely of that kid from earlier

<a id="ps-4"></a>
4. It was a school district
policy to check our personnel and bags for any guns/drugs before we went on an overnight field-trip

<a id="ps-5"></a>
5. Does that not explain the code quality? Beginning programmers and
then me coming in and being pressured to make hacky code work in 3 hours?

<a id="ps-6"></a>
6. The Mothers who helped on the team and stayed there each Saturday were also asked to weigh in on the proportions and they ended up having a rather detailed debate over the breast proportions.

<a id="ps-7"></a>
7. Now let me tell you, be glad I am not
an artist, because if I was - I would have created a scantly clad male version as well just to be
sassy to him

<a id="ps-8"></a>
8. Some even got in trouble with their teams for spending too much time playing and trying to beat high scores!
